		<h1>What can humans do to reduce the amount of land that cars use</h1>

Earlier this year, the Department of Transportation held a contest asking dozens of local governments to submit visions for a "city of the future" that incorporate things like self-driving cars to tackle problems like congestion and climate change.
Columbus, Ohio, ended up winning the contest with a detailed plan to improve mobility in low-income areas. But let’s take a closer look at San Francisco’s submission, because it’s a great exploration of how cities might use new tech and business models to take back scarce land from cars.
The proposal starts by observing that San Francisco currently has 440,000 on-street parking spaces — the same amount of land as the Golden Gate Park and 120 Transamerica buildings. And much of that land sits empty much of the time. "Our plan," the proposal notes, "would phase in innovative technologies that allow us to repurpose public space currently under-utilized as parking into affordable housing, small parks and pedestrian amenities."
The first step would be to make ride-sharing services (including, but not limited to, Uber and Lyft) more convenient and accessible to residents. After all, if people can use these cars for their transportation needs, or combine them with mass transit options, they wouldn’t need nearly as much street parking. And because each of these cars serves multiple passengers, they take up less space on the road.
In phase one, San Francisco planned to shift 10 percent of single-occupancy vehicle trips to transit and ride hailing. To do so, the city proposed partnering with the University of California Berkeley and various tech companies to work out ways to:
1) Provide incentives to shift people from their own cars into car sharing: That might mean designating certain road lanes as only available for ride sharing, making them the faster option. It might also entail seamlessly integrating car sharing, bike sharing, and public transit by creating a single simple mobile app that combines routing, scheduling, and payment for all of those services.
2) Make these services more affordable: That might involve providing low-income residents with access to smartphones and banking services, as well as providing free public wifi so that all could use these services. It would also mean finding ways to lower the price of car sharing — say, by deploying larger six-person passenger vans to cut costs below what an Uber or Lyft ride currently costs.
3) Eventually move to automated electric vehicles: If self-driving cars and buses eventually become a reality, they too could be connected into a centralized network, making sharing even easier. In theory, these vehicles could also reduce fatal collisions (assuming that self-driving technology proves safer) and would also eliminate air pollution (assuming that the cars were all electrified rather than running on gasoline).
The proposal offered an illustration of how these different phases would unfold. Note that over time, the amount of land required for parking shrinks as people move from a vehicle ownership model to a transportation service model that encompassed everything from cars to Muni buses to delivery vans:<p>

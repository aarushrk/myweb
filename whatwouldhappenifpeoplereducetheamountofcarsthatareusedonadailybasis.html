		<h1>What would happen if people reduce the amount of cars that are used on a daily basis</h1>
		<p>Timothy Papandreou, the former head of the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency’s Office of Innovation, described the goal to the Washington Post in June: "We can move the same amount of people with a tenth of the vehicles. ... It’s really going to open up our minds. We’re not going to need to have all that excess road space."
Now, San Francisco didn’t win the federal contest or the $50 million grant that came with it. But SFMTA spokesperson Paul Rose told me they’re still looking to move forward with many of the plan’s components. The city is applying for another federal grant to launch pilot programs around "connected carpool lanes, smart traffic signals, autonomous shuttles, dynamic carpool pick-up curbs, connected Vision Zero corridor, and Congestion Toll System," Rose said. "We expect a decision this month on this application."
We shouldn’t underrate the challenges here. Reducing the number of vehicles on the road will require persuading people to give up their privately owned cars and shift to a pure sharing model. That’s not easy. It involves changing some deep-seated behaviors, and policymakers and companies will have to get the incentives just right. If ride sharing remains unaffordable, or if people simply don’t want to give up their cars, the plan could easily stumble.
Still, San Francisco has all the reason in the world to try. The city has sharp geographic constraints, and skyrocketing housing prices are making the area unaffordable for many. Reformers often focus on changing the Bay Area’s zoning laws to build more housing on existing land, and that’s no doubt part of a solution. But reclaiming vehicle space for housing could prove an equally appealing concept.
San Francisco’s transit officials aren’t the only ones thinking about how new tech might decrease the amount of space that cars take up. A fascinating recent study by two British engineering firms, Farrells and WSP|Parsons Brinckerhoff, looked at how London’s streets might be entirely redesigned if self-driving cars ever became a reality.
That study imagined a world in which the autonomous vehicles (AVs) of the future are shared rather than owned — you call for an AV, and it zips right to your door. The AVs themselves are either always on the road, picking up and dropping off passengers, or charging/refueling/parking in a few centralized locations. As such, there’s simply less need for street parking.
What’s more, if all the cars on the road were autonomous, they could take up far less space on the road. Vehicles navigated by robots could nestle closer together without fear of rear-ending each other. If collisions became more rare, the cars themselves could be smaller and thinner, taking up less space. City planners could reduce the width of streets or even cut back on the number of lanes without greatly affecting travel times.
If you pushed this far enough, the study notes, a city like London could gain another 15 to 20 percent of developable area. "This is primarily due to the removal of almost all parking spaces, but also because of roadspace simplification that will save space."
"Of the estimated 8,000 hectares of central London land occupied by parked cars today, it is reasonable to assume that 50-70% — potentially more than 5,000 hectares — could be released once AVs are commonly in use," the study notes. Replacing those spots with housing or other structures would be worth tens of billions of dollars.
Of course, this is just a vision of what could be — someday. There are tons of hurdles in getting there. For starters, despite all the hype, there are no autonomous vehicles yet available that can handle the range of surprises that might pop up in an urban environment on a daily basis. As I’ve written before, the toughest thing for an autonomous vehicle to handle is other people — particularly reading and reacting to pedestrians, cyclists, and other human drivers. So we’re a ways from true self-driving cars that require no human intervention. It might be years; it might be decades.
What’s more, the transition is likely to be messy. Self-driving cars are most valuable when all the cars on the road are self-driving (that’s when you can get these cars to platoon closely together, for instance, or move more quickly through intersections). As long as there are still some human drivers on the road, though, it’s much harder to get the full benefit from autonomous vehicles. Perhaps the shift will happen naturally, as insurance rates for "manually driven" vehicles go up. Or perhaps cities will have to force the transition through policy.
So for now, think of this report as more of a utopian daydream — the culmination of a slow change in vehicle technology that will eventually let cities devote less space to vehicles and more space to, well, everybody else.
Cities can reclaim vehicle space in low-tech ways, too
Up until now, we’ve mostly been looking at newfangled technology: connected ride-sharing systems and autonomous vehicles. But it’s worth adding that cities don’t have to wait for Silicon Valley to come along before they can reclaim space from cars. There are plenty of low-tech solutions, too, from boosting mass transit to promoting walking and cycling to simple changes in parking policy.
Just as one example, Donald Shoup, an economist at UCLA, has long argued that cities have overbuilt and over-mandated parking. They do this partly by providing free street parking for all. But perhaps more importantly, many cities require all new developments to include specified large numbers of added parking spaces.
This is essentially a mandate for more parking — even if the demand isn’t there. In Washington, DC, the underground spots many developers build to comply with these minimum requirements cost between $30,000 and $50,000 each. It ends up driving up housing prices. And, of course, it means less space for other purposes.
Shoup has argued for a whole spate of changes in parking policy. But one of his simplest recommendations is to simply do away with minimum requirements for off-street parking for new buildings. "I'm pro-choice," he told Vox. "Let the developers build however many parking spots they want." (Developers would no doubt still build parking spots to accommodate demand — they just wouldn’t be required to build more than the market could bear.)
It’s not as efficient as a city full of shared, autonomous, connected, electric vehicles. But it’s the same principle. Cars take up a lot of space. One way to make cities better and more prosperous would be to find ways to reduce that space.<p>
